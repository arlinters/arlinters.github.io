Hi there!

My name is Charles. 

I’m attending Fort Hays State University for Computer Science and work as a Systems Administrator. I’m looking forward to use this space as a place to layout my thoughts on what I am working on or things that I find interesting. Projects that I work on or contribute to can be viewed at my [Github page](https://github.com/arlinters).
